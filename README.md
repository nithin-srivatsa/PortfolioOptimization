# Portfolio Optimization
I used optimization algorithms to build an optimal portfolio of stocks, experimenting with different approaches like Early Stopping, Optimality Gap, Solve to Optimality and so on. 
I utilized Gurobi to optimize a set of stocks to identify the portfolio with the least risk. We look at monthly returns, portfolio variance and diversification of several stocks to build the optimal portfolio.

Key lesson: There is an advantage in using an optimality gap or a time cut off. It may be beneficial in certain cases to get close, but not waste further computational resources in finding "THE" optimal solution.
